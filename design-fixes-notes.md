# Kai Command Design Fixes - Observations from Original

## Key Differences to Fix:

### 1. Sidebar Background
- Original: Very dark, almost pure black (#0F172A or darker)
- Current: Slate blue (#1E293B) - needs to be darker

### 2. Top Bar
- Original: WHITE background with dark text "Dashboard"
- Current: Dark background - WRONG, needs to be white
- "Sidebar" button: Coral/red background when active
- "Top Menu" button: Gray text when inactive
- These appear to be a TOGGLE (one or the other selected, not both)

### 3. New Chat Button
- Original: BLACK/dark background with white "+" and "Chat" text
- Shape: Rectangular with rounded corners
- Current: Coral/red - needs to change to black

### 4. Swivel Bar
- Original: Has a vertical drag handle between Command Center and main panel
- Used to resize the panels
- Current: Missing

### 5. Toggle Buttons (Sidebar/Top Menu)
- Original: Single toggle-style control
- When "Sidebar" selected: Red/coral background
- When "Top Menu" selected: Would be red/coral
- Unselected: Gray text
- Current: Two separate buttons - needs to be toggle style

### 6. Expandable Chat Bar
- Original: Has expand/collapse option for the input area
- Current: Missing
